 Fun Etch-A-Sketch toy!

 It works by css styling on mouse hovers in a dynamically created grid. You can change the size of the grid (I don't recommend going higher than 100x100), switch to random colors, or use a grayscale palette that increases the opacity on each pass.

 TODO:
  - Add better CSS styling for the main page
  - Set hard limit to 100 for grid size
